                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Starting at the young age of 5, Bridget was introduced into the creative world of dance. Ever since then she has delved into multiple creative feilds including: webpage design, musical theater, clarinet, choreography, cooking, drawing, acting, writing, and crafts. She is excited about her new endeavor into coding and looks forward to what the future will bring with the new skills.</p>
                <p>Along with her creative endeavors she also enjoys the worlds of sports and outdoor activities. She frequently kayaks with her husband and dog around the Cleveland area. An avid camper and hiker, she even backpacked Devil's Canyon in Grand Teton National Park while on a road trip vacation from Ohio to Yellowstone, camping through 7 states. She can frequently be found on the corner of Carnegie and Ontario cheering on her Cleveland Indians as a season ticket holder. An avid football fan, she has been a die hard through all the ups and (mostly) downs of her beloved Cleveland Browns and is excited for next year (but for real this time!). </p>
